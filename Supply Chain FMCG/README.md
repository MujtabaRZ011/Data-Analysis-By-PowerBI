Exciting Update! Just completed a significant Data Analysis project on generating Insights to solve a Supply Chain Issue in the FMCG domain! 

## Problem Statement: 
AtliQ Mart is facing a challenge with customer contracts due to delivery issues. Some key customers haven't renewed, possibly because essential products weren't delivered on time or in full. To ensure smooth growth and expansion plans, our focus is on swiftly resolving these service issues. 

## Task: 
Stepping into the role, the main objective here is to craft vital metrics [OT%, IF%, and OTIF%] according with the needs outlined by the stakeholders during the live business review meeting. The goal is not just here to create metrics but to ensure they align seamlessly with the collective vision for success.

## Key Insights:
•	Metrics like OT%, IF%, & OTIF% consistently falling short. <br>
•	Daily trends consistently missing set targets.<br>
•	No big improvements noticed recently.<br>

## Implications & Opportunities: 
Found a notable gap in IF% for many customers, signaling an area needing attention. 

## Learnings: 
Explored supply chain terms, learned new DAX functions and used cool features like Sparklines, Buttons and bookmarks for better visuals and navigation 

## Tool Used:
PowerBi (Data Analysis, Dashboard & Visualsation)

## Feedback Needed:
I invite you to explore the dashboard. Your valuable feedback is crucial for my skill enhancement.

Thank you!
