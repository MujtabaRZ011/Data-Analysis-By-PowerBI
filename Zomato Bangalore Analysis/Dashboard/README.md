## Exciting News!
Hey everyone! I just wrapped up a cool data analysis project and this time it's all about the food scene in Bangalore using Zomato data! 

## Check out the Features: 
### Filters Magic: 
You can play with filters to see different types of restaurants (like buffets, cafes, delivery, etc.), you can check for online orders or table bookings, explore different locations and dive into various cuisines.
### Numbers That Matter: 
I crunched some numbers to give you the average rating, total votes and average bill amount. Basically, what makes a restaurant stand out.
### Discover the Best: 
Find out the top cuisines and the coolest restaurants that everyone is talking about in Bangalore.

## Why It's Cool: 
This project is like your foodie guide to Bangalore. Want to know where people love ordering online or which cuisine rocks the city? This dashboard is very helpful for that.

## Learnings: 
I got to learn the ins and outs of Power BI, created some slicers and turned the raw data into easy to read charts. It was like turning food data into a visual feast.

## Tool Used:
PowerBi (Data Analysis, Dashboard & Visualsation)

## Feedback Needed:
I invite you to explore the dashboard. Your valuable feedback is very crucial for my skill enhancement.

## Big Thanks: 
A very big thanks to the Kaggle for this awesome Zomato dataset which helps me doing this tasty project. Super excited to keep exploring the world of data and food adventures.

Thank you!
