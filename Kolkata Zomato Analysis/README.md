## Exciting Zomato Data Analysis Project!
I am very excited to share the results of my recent data analysis project using the Kolkata Zomato dataset. I explored the food scene in Kolkata and made a cool dashboard in PowerBI to tell the story of dining in the city. Check out some of the cool features and things I have founded.
